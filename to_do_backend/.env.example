# Backend environment configuration for local development

# PUBLIC_INTERFACE
# PORT controls which port the Express server listens on. Default: 4000
PORT=4000

# PUBLIC_INTERFACE
# HEALTHCHECK_PATH defines the health endpoint path. Default: /health
HEALTHCHECK_PATH=/health

# FRONTEND_URL sets the allowed CORS origin and must match the browser origin of the frontend.
# For local development with the React app, this is typically:
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Integration notes with the frontend (React):
# - The frontend should set:
#     REACT_APP_API_BASE=http://localhost:${PORT}/api
# - Requests will hit:
#     GET     ${REACT_APP_API_BASE}/todos
#     POST    ${REACT_APP_API_BASE}/todos
#     PUT     ${REACT_APP_API_BASE}/todos/:id
#     PATCH   ${REACT_APP_API_BASE}/todos/:id/toggle
#     DELETE  ${REACT_APP_API_BASE}/todos/:id
